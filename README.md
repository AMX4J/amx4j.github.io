# Welcome to AMX4J

## About AMX4J

AMX4J is a [**Metamod**](http://metamod.org/) plugin which is originally inspired by [AMX Mod X](http://www.amxmodx.org), that introduces an *Object-Oriented* approach to write mods for Half-Life 1. Just like AMX Mod X, AMX4J supplies a complete platform on which you can write a vast variety of *plugins* that could be a fun mod, some administrative/statistics service, or a gameplay update in the well known [Java Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

Reasons to switch to AMX4J:

 - **Compiler Design:** The AMX4J utilizes a better (Java) compiler design, so you can just write code and the compiler will take care of converting you code into optimized binaries.
 
 - **The IDE Factor:** Java language has a lots of IDEs available for you to use, so you can write your mods in efficiently faster and smarter way.
 
 - **Has a lots of utility functions:** AMX4J got a wide array of built-in utility functions, so that you don't have to re-implement something in every mod you write and make your source shorter.
 
 - **Support to add external libraries:** So you wanna do those complex operations on a [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) object but you're feeling lazy and you really want to add a utility jar file that you created four years ago? Go ahead, AMX4J supports that too!
